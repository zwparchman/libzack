This library contains simple functionality that I finally got sick of copy-pasting.

The functionality includes

Timer - An easy to use timing class  

Channel - A go inspired channel class for inter-process communication  

utility - a few math functions that work all standard (real, complex numbers are untested) numeric types including linear interpolation (lerp), normalizing a value to a range, mapping a value from one range to another (remap), and clamping a value to a range.  
The utility functions use c assertions to enforce their preconditions.
